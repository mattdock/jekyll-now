Why obsurdity and not absurdity?

An absurdity is the quality or state of being ridiculous or wildly unreasonable.

Obscurity is concealed, not discovered or known about.  Maybe something that is hard to understand.

Hence, Obsurdity. 

An obscure absurdity.  Something that has the quality or state of being ridiculous or wildly unreasonable but is not well know, not yet discovered, concealed or hard to understand.
